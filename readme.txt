### Turn Gravity Forms into a Directory plugin
Gravity Forms is already the easiest form plugin - its functionality makes WordPress <em>close</em> to having user-submitted directory capabilities. Finally, the Gravity Forms Directory & Addons plugin does just that.

* Completely shortcode based, using the `[directory]` shortcode
* Includes built-in __searching__ 
* Sort by each column
* Easily re-organize the columns inside Gravity Forms
* Has an option to <strong>show only approved listings</strong>
* Show or hide any column
* Directory features pagination
* Define custom styles inside the shortcode
* Includes lightbox support for uploaded images

####Insert a totally configurable table using the editor
There are over 30 configurable options for how you want the directory to display. 

###Improve Gravity Forms Functionality and Usability

* Expand the Add Fields boxes to view all the boxes at once.
* Edit form entries directly from the Entries page (saving two clicks)
* Easily access form data to use in your website with PHP functions - [Learn more on the plugin's website](http://www.seodenver.com/gravity-forms-addons/)
